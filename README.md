### Context:

Efficient employee management is crucial for effectively tracking roles, salaries, and departments. An Employee Management System automates this process, making it easier to classify different types of employees and calculate their compensations based on specific roles.

An Employee Management System built in C++ addresses this challenge by creating a structured and scalable solution. By modeling different employee types in a hierarchical way, the system ensures clean code organization while allowing for easy future expansions, such as adding new roles or integrating database storage.

- Inheritance allows different employee types (e.g., Manager, Developer) to share common attributes (name, ID, base salary) while adding specialized fields (department, programming language). This avoids code duplication and improves maintainability.

- Polymorphism enables dynamic salary calculations; for example, managers might receive a fixed bonus, while developers could earn incentives based on skills. This flexibility mirrors real payroll systems.
